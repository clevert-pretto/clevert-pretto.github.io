Actually till now I was just hardcore programmer. I don't know how to maintain my codes, How to use the readily available resources to make my programming easier and simpler. Most of the times, I got an  idea, but because of insufficient knowledge base, resources(we can say software tools, Open source platform or even working Internet connection) I was unable to take them in the living world. Now I am learning and progressing day by day, achieving small milestones. Hope you would like to check my future posts and listen to me.
